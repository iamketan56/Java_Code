<b>4.Collect and Group Cards<br>
 Write a program to collect and store all the cards to assist the users in finding all the cards in a given 
symbol.
This cards game consist of N number of cards. Get N number of cards details from the user and store 
the values in Card object with the attributes symbol and number.
Store all the cards in a map with symbol as its key and list of cards as its value. Map is used here to 
easily group all the cards based on their symbol.
Once all the details are captured print all the distinct symbols in alphabetical order from the Map. For 
 each symbol print all the card details, number of cards and their sum respectively.<b></br>

 <b>5.Collect Unique Symbols From Set of Cards</br>
 Playing cards during travel is a fun filled experience. For this game they wanted to collect all four 
unique symbols. Can you help these guys to collect unique symbols from a set of cards?
Create Card class with attributes symbol and number. From our main method collect each card 
details (symbol and number) from the user.
Collect all these cards in a set, since set is used to store unique values or objects.
Once we collect all four different symbols display the first occurrence of card details in alphabetical 
order.<b></br>
